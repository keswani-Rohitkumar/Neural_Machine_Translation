# Neural_Machine_Translation
Neural Machine Translation using seq-to-seq encoder decoder architecture
The seq-to-seq model is widely used in machine translation system such as Google's Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT).

In this project we are using Vietnamese Language as our Source sentence and translating it to English language which is our target language.

I achievd a BLEU score of 4.76 without attention and BLEU score of 15.40 with attention.
