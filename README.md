# Neural_Machine_Translation
Neural Machine Translation using seq-to-seq encoder decoder architecture
The seq-to-seq model is widely used in machine translation system such as Google's Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT).

In this project I used Vietnamese Language as the Source sentence and translating it to English language which is the target language.

I achieved a BLEU score of 4.76 without attention and BLEU score of 15.40 with attention.
